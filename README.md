<h2>Inspiration</h2>
Inspired by the waste left behind during apartment moves, our project aims to transform unwanted furniture and items into opportunities for others. We believe in the power of sharing and community, where small acts of kindness can have a big impact. Join us in giving new life to items and creating a more caring, sustainable world.

<h2>What it does</h2>
This project enables users to easily donate items they no longer need, such as furniture, electronics, and clothing, to others in their community. By repurposing and sharing these items, it reduces waste, fosters community spirit, and promotes sustainability, contributing to a more caring and environmentally conscious society.

<h2>How we built it</h2>
We managed to build it collaboratively within the scope of multiple challenges. We started with ideation, planning, and selecting the right technology stack. Development included creating core features, designing an intuitive user interface, and integrating a secure database. Rigorous testing and deployment followed.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
Understanding and implementing new technologies in the given amount of time and also integrating the idea to aid community using the skills that we have can be tricky sometimes.

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
We are proud that we got our project up and running after all the challenges we went through. Also we tried to cover up most challenges in this hackathon.

<h2>What we learned</h2>
Firstly, this project served as a valuable opportunity for us to learn and navigate new technologies while discovering their capabilities and limitations. Secondly, it was an enriching learning experience that not only deepened our understanding of cutting-edge technology but also allowed us to successfully translate that knowledge into a tangible project. This was a testament to our commitment to continuous growth and innovation through our journey.

<h2>What's next for Community Aid</h2>
There is surely a lot of scope for our project which we could not implement in the given time. We can add a map where we can see all the donors nearby, we can add an analytical tool that will give us a probability of getting the required donation at certain location, and also we can add a messenger chat feature for users to close the deal.
